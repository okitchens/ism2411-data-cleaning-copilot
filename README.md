# ISM2411 Data Cleaning Project

This project contains a Python script that cleans a small sales dataset as part of the ISM2411 Data Cleaning assignment. The script loads the raw CSV file, cleans the column names, removes extra whitespace, handles missing values, and removes invalid rows before saving a cleaned version of the dataset.

## Files in This Repository
- `data/raw/sales_data_raw.csv` — original dataset provided for the assignment  
- `data/processed/sales_data_clean.csv` — cleaned dataset produced by the script  
- `data_cleaning.py` — main script that performs all cleaning steps  
- `reflection.md` — written reflection describing how Copilot assisted in the project  

## How to Run the Script
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.  
2. Install pandas if needed:  
3. From the project folder, run:
4. The cleaned file will appear in `data/processed/`.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates basic data cleaning techniques in Python and how GitHub Copilot can be used as a tool to support (but not replace) the coding process.
